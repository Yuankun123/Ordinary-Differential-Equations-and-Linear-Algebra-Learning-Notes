# Ordinary-Differential-Equations-and-Linear-Algebra-Learning-Notes

This is a Learning Note for Ordinary Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. Everyone is welcome to improve it.

For the editting notes, I recommend to use .md (Markdown) files. The greatest feature is that it supports Latex syntax for math formula. Of course, only some renderers can handle this. I recommend MarkText.

I have uploaded PDF versions for easier viewing. However, it is very likely that I may forget to update them when I make a change in the .md files. If anyone see it, please don't hesitate to report via the issues page.

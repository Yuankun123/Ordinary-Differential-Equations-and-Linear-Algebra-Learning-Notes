## Fundamentals

### Definition:

A first order ODE (i.e. Ordinary Differential Equation) has the following form

$$
{dy\over dx} = f(x, y)
$$

where y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable.

### Separability:

An ODE is separable if and only if it can be written as

$$
\begin{aligned}
{dy \over dx} &= g(x) \cdot h(y) \\
\Longrightarrow {dy \over h(y) dx} &= g(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

so that it can be solved simply by taking integral at the both sides

$$
\int {dy \over h(y)dx} dx = \int g(x) dx
$$

### Equilibrium Solution

An equilibrium solution (if any) is a constant function that safisties a given D.E. In order to find them, we can simply let all derivatives to be zero and solve for the unknown function.

Note: the result MUST be a constant function of the independent variable. (i.e. $y(x) = 1$ is acceptable, but $x = 1$ is NOT.)

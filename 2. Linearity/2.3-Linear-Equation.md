## Linear Equations

### Definition

Given a linear operator $L$, an equation having the form

$$
L(\bold{x}) = \bold{c}
$$

is a linear equation, where $\bold{x}$ and $\bold{c}$ are two vectors.

### Homogeneous and Non-homogeneous Linear Equation

A linear equation $L(\bold{x}) = \bold{c}$ is *homogeneous* if  $\bold{c}= \bold{0}$  and is *non-homogeneous* otherwise. 

$L(\bold{x}) = \bold{0}$ is said to be the *corresponding homogeneous equation* of $L(\bold{x}) = \bold{c}$. When $L$ is clear in the context, solutions of $L(\bold{x}) = \bold{0}$ are referred as *homogeneous solutions*, and the set of them as *homogeneous solution set*.

### Superposition Principle

#### Theorem

Given a homogeneous linear equation

$$
L(\bold{x}) = \bold{0} \tag{1}

$$

If $\bold{x}_{1}$ and $\bold{x}_{2}$ are two solutions, all linear combinations of them are also the solution of $(1)$

#### Proof

Let $C(\bold{x}_{1}, \bold{x}_{2})$ be a linear combination,

$$
L(C(\bold{x}_{1}, \bold{x}_{2})) = C(L(\bold{x}_{1}), L(\bold{x}_{2}))
 = C(\bold{0}, \bold{0})=\bold{0}
$$

#### Notes:

- The proof doesn't require $\bold{x}_{1}$ and $\bold{x}_{2}$ to be distinct, so the theorem works even if we can only find one solution: if $\bold{x}_{1}$ is a solution, and $a$ is a real number, then $a\bold{x}_{1}$ is also a solution.

### Non-homogeneous Principle

#### Theorem

Given a non-homogeneous linear equation

$$
L(\bold{x}) = \bold{c} \tag{2}

$$

if $\bold{x}_{p}$ is a particular solution of $(2)$, then a vector $\bold{x}_q$ is also a solution of $(2)$ if and only if it can be expressed as $\bold{x}_{p} + \bold{x}_{h}$, where $\bold{x}_h$ is a homogeneous solution. Or, more formally,

$$
L(\bold{x}_p) = L(\bold{x}_q) = \bold{c} \iff 
\exist \bold{x}_h(L(\bold{x}_h)= \bold{0} \land
\bold{x}_q = \bold{x}_p +\bold{x}_h) \tag{3}
$$

#### Proof

$(3)$ is equivalent to

$$
L(\bold{x}_p) = L(\bold{x}_q) = \bold{c}  \iff 
L(\bold{x}_q - \bold{x}_p) = \bold{0} \tag{4}

$$

which is then equivalent to

$$
L(\bold{x}_p) = L(\bold{x}_q) = \bold{c}  \iff 
L(\bold{x}_q) - L(\bold{x}_p) = \bold{0} \tag{5}
$$

which is obviously correct.

#### Notes:

- The solution set of a non-homogeneous equation can be obtained by adding a particular solution to each element of the homogeneous solution set.

### Linear Algebraic Equations

A linear algebraic equation has the form

$$
L(\bold{x}) = \bold{c}
$$

where $L$ is a linear operator, and $\bold{x} = (x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$ is a vector with its components corresponded to the unknown variables of the equation.
